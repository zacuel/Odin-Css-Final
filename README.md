Here are my recommended colors and fonts: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png

Also taking another deep dive into GIT. GIT IT


After this, I will make a silly change to something.. so I can learn to check out the commit before the commit. will it branch? will it override? 

also it seems like git is doing a lot of heavy lifting. 

I think that when I cloned the project it also cloned my previous commits. I could figure this out now, or start building. 

first im going to make a commit with this and the html spelled out. 

does capitolization matter to the command line? it doesnt matter to it as far as directeries go.
