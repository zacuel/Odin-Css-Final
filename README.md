Here are my recommended colors and fonts: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png

Also taking another deep dive into GIT. GIT IT

it seems I have to make a commit every time I change something. BOOOOO idk seems stupid.

After this, I will make a silly change to something.. so I can learn to check out the commit before the commit. will it branch? will it override? 

also it seems like git is doing a lot of heavy lifting.
